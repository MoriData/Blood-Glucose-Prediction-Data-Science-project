# Blood Glucose Prediction Data Science Project

This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting blood glucose levels using advanced machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.


## Introduction

Blood glucose prediction is crucial for the management of diabetes, a condition affecting millions worldwide. This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict glucose levels, providing insights that could support better health management.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset that includes various features such as:
- Time-based glucose measurements
- Dietary habits
- Physical activity
- Other relevant health indicators

The dataset is processed to handle missing values, normalize features, and engineer new attributes to enhance model performance.
